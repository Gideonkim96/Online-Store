Lab scenario
In this lab, you will be part of an elite team that has been tasked with building an online store from the ground up. Your company is relying on you to deliver a fully functioning digital shopping experience. As a backend software developer, you will work closely with a front-end developer and a database engineer to build a full-stack web-based solution. The final product will allow a user to: load a shopping web page from the backend, display and filter relevant products as well as their price and description, add products to their shopping cart, and complete the purchase by placing an order. Your role in this project will be to build a complete backend solution using the most widely used programming language and framework for such a task: Java and Spring Boot.
